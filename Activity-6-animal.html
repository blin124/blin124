        <h1>Rabbits</h1>
        <p>Rabbits are so cute, small, chubby and they love to eat their own poop.</p>
        <p>Rabbits are herbivores. This means that they have a plant-based diet and do not eat meat. Their diets include grasses, clover and some cruciferous plants, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. They are opportunistic feeders and also eat fruits, seeds, roots, buds, and tree bark, according to ADW.</p>
